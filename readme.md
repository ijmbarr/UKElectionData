A collection of data about UK general elections. 

Where possible I have included an about.txt file to explain where the data was obtained from.

All of this data was collected from secondary sources - there is no guarantee that it is correct. Where possible I have run a few consistency checks, but there is a good chance there might still be mistakes. If you have any corrections, let me know.
